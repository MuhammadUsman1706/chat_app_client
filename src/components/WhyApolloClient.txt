Notes:
1) You have to write this lengthy code to fetch data normally, using useEffect, etc.
2) Apollo Client has other benefits like caching the data, etc to make your website run faster. Plus it provides you data, loading and error for user guide. Also provides a method for performing a function automatically after performing query or mutation.
3) This is the normal method:

  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  const getMessages = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:4000/", {
      // Method will always be POST, no matter if we're getting or sending data
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization:
          "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImlhdCI6MTY1NzE0MjIxMn0.QzooCCmi1TmG9t6r7E_aq7r2Ei_nYSyRGXM3kRWcBq4",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        // It will always be query, doesn't matter if you are performing a query/mutation
        query: `
        query MessagesByUser($receiverId: Int!) {
          messagesByUser(receiverId: $receiverId) {
            text
            receiverId
            senderId
            id
          }
        }
        `,
        variables: {
          receiverId: 4,
        },
      }),
    });
    const responseData = await response.json();
    console.log(responseData);
    // Set your state here
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getMessages();
  }, []);
